## Thoughts

Many others imitate the original Simon Game, some even reminiscing about their childhood. I had no such memories and couldn't really think of any interesting way to implement this game. In the end I made what can be called a rough sketch of the original idea. All these bubbles floating up through ocean depths and colored ball bobbing up and down... There was something in this.
As usual this was also an opportunity to try something new - ES6 Classes this time! I know it sounds very silly, but somehow I never had a project where it seemed OK to use them freely. And here they are! All these little bubbles are instances of a Class!
